# BomberMan Game

### A BomberMan game that you and your friends can play together

## Task
Write a web-crawler to gather used car data from the official page of Audi and build regression models to analyze the correlations between variables.
For example, analyze the correlation between the mileage and the price of the used car.

### Run Locally
* Run this Command: git clone <https://github.com/b05702057/Audi-Used-Car-Market-Analysis.git>
* Change directory to the where the file "Audi_Data_Web_Crawler.py" is saved
* Install all the toolkits used in this project
* Run this Command: python Audi_Data_Web_Crawler.py

  If the situation happens, please notify me, and I will fix the problems as soon as possible.
